# The Second Principle: Time

- Focus on developing pieces and try to avoid moving a single piece twice
- Try not developing queen early in the game.
- Try to develop minor pieces then queen, castle and then attack.

## Going for a Gambit

- Gambit is a voluntary sacrifice of a piece or pawn in the opening with the idea of a lead in development and subsequent attack as compensation.
