# The Third Principle: Space

- When you have advantage in space, you control more trritory than your opponent
- Your pieces have more sqaures to choose from than the enemy pieces, which are severely restricted in their movements.

## The Space Count System

- White owns the ranks from 1 to 4, while black owns the ranks from 5 to 8.
- Anything controlled beyond these personal squares in the enemey domain is accounted in space count system.
- Other factors to consider are:
    - Can king castle?
    - Pawn/Piece advantage
    - Pawn islands?
    - Rook on active files
    - etc.
