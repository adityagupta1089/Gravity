1. For a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $d$, we had $p(x)=f(x)g(x)$, we concluded that $p(x)-f(x)g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree atmost $d$, hence can have atmost $d$ roots which are false-positives in this case. The probability that $n(>d)$ elements chosen out of $$\{1,2,\ldots10^6d\}$$ belong to these false-positives is
$$\displaystyle\le\frac{\binom n d\binom {10^6d-d}{n-d}}{\binom {10^6d}n}=\frac{n!((10^6-1)d)!}{d!(n-d)!(n-d)!(10^6d-n)!}\frac{n!(10^6d-n)!}{(10^6d)!}$$\\
which becomes $$\displaystyle\frac{n!^2((10^6-1)d)!}{d!(10^6d)!(n-d)!^2}=\frac{n^2(n-1)^2..1^2}{(n-d)^2(n-d-1)^2...1^2}\frac{1}{\binom {10^6d}d}\stackrel{n\to\infty}\longrightarrow\binom {10^6d}d^{-1}\\\displaystyle
=\frac{d(d-1)...1}{(10^6d)(10^6d-1)..(10^6d-(d-1))}\stackrel{d\to\infty}\longrightarrow \frac1{10^{6d}}$$ which is astronomically small.
2. The determinant of the [Tutte Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_matrix) which is a polynomial in $x_{ij}$'s $(i<j)$ is non-zero for a perfect-matching. Hence, we can use the polynomial verification algorithm to check if it is non-zero. Also see [this](http://www.imsc.res.in/~meena/matching/lecture7.pdf)
3. Given $F:{\mathbb Z_n}\to{\mathbb Z_m}$ s.t. $F(x+y)=F(x)+F(y)$ which is a homomorphism. Given $n$ we can estimate $F(n)$ by writing $F(z)=F(k+(z-k))=F(k)+F(z-k)$ where the probability that this is right is $1-1/9=8/9$. If we can run this 5 times, that would mean trying different combinations of $k$ and $z-k$ and taking the majority which will be correct $1-\binom 53(1/9)^3(8/9)^2-\binom 54(1/9)^4(8/9)^1-\binom 55(1/9)^5(8/9)^0=19456/19683\approx98.8\%$
4. Probability of getting a min-cut was calculated in class as $$\displaystyle\prod_{k=3}^n\left(1-\frac 2k\right)=\binom n2^{-1}$$
5. Probability of getting a min-cut after $\lambda$ operations: $1-\left(1-\binom n2^{-1}\right)^{\lambda}=1-\left(\frac{n(n-1)-2}{n(n-1)}\right)^{\lambda}\stackrel{\lambda \to\infty}\longrightarrow1$
6. $O(n!)$
7. TODO (Binary search on unsorted elements?)
