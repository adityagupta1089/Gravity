These are some of the Songs that I use to identify music intervals. Many of them are missing because I don't know many songs that I have heard frequently and have those intervals.

| Interval    | Songs (Increasing)                                           | Songs (Decreasing)                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
